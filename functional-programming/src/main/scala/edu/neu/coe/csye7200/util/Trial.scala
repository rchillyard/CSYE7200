/**
  * Classes which provide chaining of Try operations where each operation is (typically) a function which takes
  * the same parameter.
  * There are two distinct forms:
  * <ul><li>the Trial/Match classes where the function given is of the form V=>Try[T]</li>
  * <li>the LiftTrial/LiftMatch classes where the function given is of the form V=>T</li>
  * </ul>
  * The more general class of each form is Trial (LiftTrial) which takes any function which operates on the given parameter.
  * The other class is Match/LiftMatch which takes a PartialFunction of form Any=>Try[T] or Any=>T as appropriate.

# Rules.txt

# This file defines the rules that are used in the Hedge Fund application.
# There are currently two required rules: put and call.
# Each candidate option must satisfy the RHS of the appropriate rule.
# Note that the variables on the RHS must be defined as a term in the appropriate model,
#   for example GoogleOptionModel.
# And, furthermore, the term definition must correspond to a property in the
#   candidateWithProperties defined in OptionAnalyzer#applyRules

# Note also that you may have any number of (parenthetical) expressions combined with operators:
#   & (and) or | (or) but
#   that if there are multiple closing parentheses, these must be at the rightmost end of the string.
 
#put="(strikePrice > 44) & ((strikePrice < 48) & (sharpeRatio > 0.4))"
put="(strikePrice > 44) & (strikePrice < 48)"

Subject:  CCHS No Parking on Campus for Juniors? 11/3/15 Dear CCHS Families, I write to share information regarding parking on campus for juniors. In short, we would be happy to see all interested juniors be able to park on campus.  However, while we were expecting more parking spaces in the new parking lot, the Town allowed only 429 spaces (among the new main lot, loop road, and upper turf field) due to the impervious surface ratios. Currently, we need 255 spaces for faculty and staff and we have issued 171 parking permits to seniors. This brings our total number of occupied spaces to 426, and leaves three potential spaces for juniors. Know that we are all disappointed that we cannot provide parking spaces for juniors at this time; we will do our best to meet student parking requests within the given conditions. Thank you for your understanding. Sincerely, Peter Badalament Principal
